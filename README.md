The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat. 
This project aims to classify the input image as either a dog or a cat image.
In this project I have built a CNN model to classify the dogs and cats, and I used a image to predict whether it is cat or dog.
